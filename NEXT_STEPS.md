# Next Steps for Data Analysis Dojo

This document outlines the next steps for the Data Analysis Dojo project.

## Current Implementation

We have successfully implemented:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
   - Prisma ORM for database access
   - NextAuth.js for authentication

2. **Database Schema**
   - User and authentication models
   - Learning content models (Module, Activity, Skill)
   - Progress tracking models (UserProfile, UserSkillProficiency, UserActivityProgress)

3. **Core Pages**
   - Home page
   - Dashboard
   - Modules listing and detail pages
   - Activity pages
   - Skills matrix page
   - Authentication pages (login, register)

4. **Components**
   - User profile card
   - Skill matrix visualizer
   - Module navigator
   - Activity components (Learn, Practice, Apply, Assess)
   - Code editor

5. **API Endpoints**
   - User profile
   - Modules and activities
   - Activity submission and grading

6. **Sample Data**
   - Seed script with demo user, skills, modules, and activities

## Next Steps

### 1. Database Setup and Migration

Before running the application, you need to:

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database
2. Update the `.env` file with your database connection string
3. Run the Prisma migrations:
   ```
   npm run prisma:migrate
   npm run prisma:generate
   ```
4. Seed the database:
   ```
   npm run prisma:seed
   ```

### 2. Content Development

The application needs more content:

1. **Additional Modules**: Create more modules covering different chapters of the book
2. **More Activities**: Develop a variety of activities for each module
3. **Comprehensive Skill Matrix**: Expand the skill matrix with more detailed skills

### 3. Feature Enhancements

Consider implementing these features:

1. **Code Execution Environment**: Set up a secure environment for executing user code
2. **Enhanced Auto-Grading**: Improve the auto-grading logic for more accurate feedback
3. **Progress Visualization**: Add more visualizations for tracking progress
4. **Social Features**: Add leaderboards, sharing, and collaboration features
5. **Notifications**: Implement notifications for achievements and new content

### 4. Testing

Implement comprehensive testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints and database interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test user flows through the application

### 5. Deployment

Prepare for production deployment:

1. **Environment Configuration**: Set up production environment variables
2. **Database Migration**: Plan for database migrations in production
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up continuous integration and deployment
4. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring
